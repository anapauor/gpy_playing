Title: McDonald’s to open first CosMc’s spinoff restaurant this week

Comments: 

*seeing people hate on this idea here*

Damn I should buy more
On the one hand, lower cost/footprint locations that just sell higher margin snacks isn't a bad idea.  Hell, a drive through booth that just pumps out McMuffins exclusively would probably do well.  Or imagine if they redo their soft serve contract for Cosmc purposes and pump out those products reliably.

But basing it around the odd "Cosmc" character is weird and probably unnecessary.  At least they didn't base it around the creepy moon-headed one.

If ultra high margin "pretzel bites" take off, then RIP our society.

I work for a company owned by DE, so I invest heavily in DE. It's always fun to jokingly remind my boss that as I am a shareholder, he works for me.

Title: Magnificent Rotation - In the year to November 16th, the Magnificent 7 contributed around 84% of the S&P 500's growth (5x the rest)

Comments: 

I think mega cap tech was oversold in 2022 and is about fair value currently. 

GOOGL is the only individual stock I own; the majority is in VTI. I don’t have enough confidence in other sectors (healthcare, energy, consumables, etc) to make a “bet” otherwise but last year felt confident and bought GOOGL at $100. 

I can definitely see a future 20 years from now that allows for significantly more growth for a company like Alphabet or Microsoft than Ford or Exxon. I may be wrong and that’s the risk of buying individual stocks rather than a total market approach.

Especially considering mega-cap tech strength in the current relatively higher interest rate environment it also allows for the possibility of significant short-term appreciation when/if rates are cut..
Makes sense. They are 30% of the index and the most successful and hot stocks in the index.

Title: Stocks that are in itself "diversified" like Berkshire Hathaway? Basically like an index funds except in a single stock?

Comments: 

In “The Alchemy of Finance,” George Soros talks about the conglomerate boom and subsequent bust of the 60’s.  Companies were buying unrelated businesses and engaging in what Peter Lynch calls “diworsification.”

The only reason Berkshire succeeded where others failed is because the CEO is one of the greatest capital managers in history.

I think a better approach is finding businesses that acquire companies that will fit into their overall ecosystem.  Some examples would be Amazon buying Ring, Google buying Android, and Microsoft buying what later became Powerpoint.
There's more in other countries, particularly Europe - but most of them pay some sort of dividend (although I think in many cases may be annual/variable if at all and not quarterly.)  Investor AB is one, Exor (basically Berkshire for the Agnelli family with the primary holding being Stellantis and Ferrari, but branching out into other areas such as luxury goods and healthcare) is another. Kinnevik hasn't done that great but perhaps will do better going forward with James Anderson as exec director. Svolder is another.  There's a bunch. In the US, with all the HHH he's buying perhaps someday Bill Ackman actually turns Howard Hughes into his own Berkshire  - who knows if that happens, but him merging his public fund with HHH has been a topic of discussion for years.

Title: Is it a good idea to put 10 dollars biweekly into a stock?

Comments: 

You are already miles ahead of most people your age by doing any sort of investing. If you want to keep it simple go with a broad based index fund. VTI,VOO,SPY, and QQQ are all great choices. There are also great dividend funds as SCHD but those also have their own pros and cons
It’s great that you’re thinking of your financial security so far in advance. Follow the /r/personalfinance flowchart and just keep reading from the various financial subs like /r/fire and /r/bogleheads

1. Focus on building an emergency fund and getting rid of any high interest debt.

2. Keep dollar cost averaging into your s&p500 position. Make sure you’re taking advantage of any tax free account benefits like a IRA/401k

3. Figure out what your financial goals are (retire at a specific date, how much will you need? Big house purchase and need a % down payment? Etc) figure out what the big goals are and then make a plan of action on how to make incremental progress to these goals.


However, the best investment you can make right now is into yourself. Work on your skills and leverage that for more compensation, what’s the use of working all your life if it’s for scraps? You need to increase your income earning potential early to reap the rewards for years to come. 

At your age I was going through the fog and changed majors a few times, it’s all different for everyone and cannot compare your path to another. Identify how you want to live you life, build that life, then save for it. As long as you keep trying your best you’ll end up fine. Good luck on your journey ✌️
